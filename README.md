# T2DM Equity-Efficiency Decision Aid Tool

## **Overview**

The **T2DM Equity-Efficiency Decision Aid Tool** is a web-based application designed to help patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) evaluate and understand their preferences for different health insurance plans covering newer T2DM treatments. By leveraging an Error-Component Logit Model based on discrete choice experiment (DCE) results, the tool provides personalized insights under varying conditions of equity and efficiency.

## **Features**

- **Three Experimental Conditions**: 
  1. **Self-focused Outcomes**: Preferences based solely on personal efficacy, risk, and cost.
  2. **Equal Health Outcomes for Self and Others**: Incorporates societal influences by considering equal health outcomes for self and other patients with poorer health.
  3. **Varying Health Outcomes for Self and Others**: Examines preferences when health outcomes and costs vary between self and other patients.

- **Interactive Inputs**: Enter demographic information and adjust plan attributes using sliders and selection options.

- **Willingness to Pay (WTP) Analysis**: Visualize how much you are willing to pay for improvements in each attribute with error bars indicating uncertainty.

- **Programme Uptake Probability**: Predict the likelihood of choosing a particular health plan based on your inputs.

- **Cost & Benefits Analysis**: Assess the cost-effectiveness of different plan scenarios, including monetized Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) benefits.

- **Scenario Management**: Save multiple plan scenarios, compare them side by side, and export your results to PDF for documentation or sharing.
